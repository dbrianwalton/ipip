<!--
The frontmatter contains a variety of items that precede
the actual content.  They tend to get placed in the "right"
place and order, and not necessarily the order they appear here.
They differ from "docinfo" items in that they will be *content*
that a reader will actually see.

The xml:id string is used to form a filename for the webpage.
Setting this one to "index" makes for a good default page
when you host your project on a server.

  <!--
  Items typically on the main title page, perhaps duplicated
  in the half-title page, page headings, etc.
  One exception - main title and (optional) subtitle follow
  the scheme for titling any division of the work.
